### Plato Pizza Project

The mission is to create a one-page dashboard based on Pizza restaurantâ€™s sales datasets over one year in order to improve restaurant operations and provide suggestions.

At first, after collecting the datasets, I used SQL to process the datasets and combine them with each other using JOINS and then selected the columns that would be useful in the analysis.

I also used the Power BI tool to create a dashboard based on the processed datasets and also to answer the analytical questions that were set, and based on the pizza category choose, the following will be obtained:

- Total orders.
- Total sales.
- Total sales by size of pizza.
- Number of products (Pizzas).
- Number of pizzas made.
- The most pizza made.
- The best selling pizza & The worst.
- The Peak & busiest hours.
- The total number of orders for each month during the year.
